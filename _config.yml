# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Night/Dark mode
# Default mode is "auto", "auto" is for auto nightshift
# (19:00 - 07:00), "manual" is for manual toggle, and
# "on/off" is for default on/off.
#
# Whatever the user's choice is, it will supersede the
# default setting of the site and be kept during the
# visit (session). Only the dark mode setting is "manual",
# it will be always kept on every visit (i.e. no matter
# the browser is closed or not)
